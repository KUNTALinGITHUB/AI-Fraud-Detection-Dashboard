# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard that combines multiple machine learning models and explainable AI to assess fraud risk in transactional data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Multi-model predictions** using:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Logistic Regression
  - Autoencoder (for anomaly detection)
- **Risk scoring**: Aggregates model outputs into a unified fraud risk score.
- **Visual analytics**:
  - Histogram of fraud risk distribution
  - Bar chart of flagged fraud vs normal transactions
  - Transaction-level risk gauge
- **Explainability**:
  - SHAP summary plot to show global feature importance
  - Highlights which features increase or decrease fraud risk

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KUNTALinGITHUB/AI-Fraud-Detection-Dashboard.git
   cd AI-Fraud-Detection-Dashboard
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the dashboard:

bash
streamlit run step4_dashboard_simple.py
Upload a CSV file with transaction data. If it contains a Class column, it will be used as ground truth.

ðŸ§  Models Used
Random Forest / XGBoost / Logistic Regression: Trained on labeled transaction data to predict fraud probability.

Autoencoder: Learns normal transaction patterns and flags anomalies based on reconstruction error.

ðŸ“Š Explainability with SHAP
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the Random Forest model:

Red bars = features that increase fraud risk

Blue bars = features that reduce fraud risk

This helps users understand why a transaction is flagged and builds trust in the model.
